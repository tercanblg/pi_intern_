**Pear Inc. Smart T-Shirt Antivirus**
Welcome to Pear Inc.! This repository contains the proof-of-concept code for a lightweight antivirus system designed to approve apps for our new line of smart t-shirts. The smart t-shirts will use Google Wear OS, allowing users to install custom programs through the Google Play Store. The antivirus ensures that only Pear Inc. approved programs can be installed to prevent ransomware and other malicious software from compromising our premium smart t-shirts.
